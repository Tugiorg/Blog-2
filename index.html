Sigh, it’s like we can’t catch a break. So much has happened over the past two years and now some experts are saying we’re heading towards a recession.
    <p class="txtpcp"> Defined as <span class="spantxt"> “a significant decline in economic activity that lasts for months or even years,”</span> a recession is classified by certain criteria. These, according to Forbes, include: negative gross domestic product <span class="spantxtgdp"> (GDP)</span>, rising levels of unemployment, falling retail sales, and contracting measures of income and manufacturing for an extended period of time.</p>


We’re not trying to be Negative Nancy…. more like Prepared Polly. It pays to be prepared, so whether the impact has been great or minimal, we want you to feel confident in your marketing strategies to survive the impending period of decreased spending. To help, let’s talk tips for marketing in a recession.

<p class="txtpcp1"> But, before we dive into the marketing tips, it’s important to briefly touch on why the recession is happening in the first place.
</p>

<h2 class="txtpch2mid"> Why Now?</h2>

It was originally speculated that, in a post-pandemic world, there’d be an economic boom. People were home, out of work, and spending less. Now—because the pandemic has slowed a bit and we’ve returned to a quasi-normal existence—experts expected an increase in demand.

<p class="txtpcp2"> With multiple factors, in addition to COVID-19, playing a part, however, the opposite happened. Forbes points to three factors that are contributing to Americans’ current concerns of a recession: inflation and supply chain disruptions, Federal interest rate hikes, and yield curve inversion.</p>

Knowing these factors could cause a recession, how should marketers prepare?


  <h2 class="marketing">  Marketing in a Recession</h2>

A recession means less consumer spending. People aren’t going to be as receptive to advertising with both prices and unemployment increasing. Marketers have to tread lightly between customer needs and selling products, understanding—and being sensitive to—the financial climate.

    <h2 class="marketingbudget">    Marketing Budget</h2>

Brands’ first instinct for marketing in a recession may be to decrease overall marketing budget. The thought being, if people aren’t going to be shopping, what’s the point in putting dollars behind marketing efforts? But, according to Harvard Business Review (HBR), that’s not necessarily the right move. In fact, according to HBR,<span class="midspantxt"> “Companies that have bounced back most strongly from previous recessions usually did not cut their marketing spend, and in many cases actually increased it.”</span>

  <p class="pctxt1">  While HBR recommends maintaining—maybe even increasing—your marketing budget during a recession, how the money is spent should change.</p>

This brings us to our first tip for marketing in a recession: reinvest in R&D.

            </div>

            <div class="midtxt2">
                <p class="midtxt2p">
                    HBR advises businesses to refocus their marketing money towards R&D and, as counterintuitive as it may be, actually launch new products during a recession.  <span class="prospan">“Products launched during a recession have both higher long-term survival chances and higher sales revenues.”</span>
                </p>
  <p class="txtp1p">  With fewer new products flooding the market and brands investing in their most promising ventures, products launched just after the midpoint of a recession end up being highly successful.
</p>
   <h2 class="h2marketing"> Marketing Promotions</h2>
<p class="classp">
With fewer sales being made, brands often jump the gun and increase their prices to make up the difference. And, as HBR points out, once it’s evident that customers still aren’t buying, these businesses then have to price-cut with promotions. What’s interesting, however, is that it’s not the price increase that decreases market share, it’s actually the flip-flopping between high and low prices that negatively impacts brands.
